# Grammar of data wrangling

## A grammar of data wrangling...

... based on the concepts of functions as verbs that manipulate data frames

.pull-left[
```{r dplyr-part-of-tidyverse, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", caption = "dplyr is part of the tidyverse"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/dplyr-part-of-tidyverse.png")
```
]
.pull-right[
.midi[
- `select`: pick columns by name
- `arrange`: reorder rows
- `slice`: pick rows using index(es)
- `filter`: pick rows matching criteria
- `distinct`: filter for unique rows
- `mutate`: add new variables
- `summarize`: reduce variables to values
- `group_by`: for grouped operations
- ... (many more)
]
]

## Rules of **dplyr** functions

- First argument is *always* a data frame
- Subsequent arguments say what to do with that data frame
- Always return a data frame
- Don't modify in place

---

## Data: Hotel bookings

- Data from two hotels: one resort and one city hotel
- Observations: Each row represents a hotel booking
- Goal for original data collection: Development of prediction models to classify a hotel booking's likelihood to be cancelled ([Antonia et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191#bib5))

```{r message=FALSE}
hotels <- read_csv("data/hotels.csv")

## Second look: Overview

## Select a single column

View only `lead_time` (number of days between booking and arrival date):

```{r}
select(hotels, lead_time)
```

---

## Select a single column

.pull-left[
```{r eval=FALSE}
select( #<<
  hotels, 
  lead_time

dplyr functions always expect a data frame and always yield a data frame.

## Select multiple columns


View only the `hotel` type and `lead_time`:

--

.pull-left[

select(hotels, hotel, lead_time)
```
]
--
.pull-right[
.question[
What if we wanted to select these columns, and then arrange the data in descending order of lead time?

## Data wrangling, step-by-step

.pull-left[
Select:
```{r}
hotels %>%
  select(hotel, lead_time)
```
]

--
.pull-right[
Select, then arrange:
```{r}
hotels %>%
  select(hotel, lead_time) %>%
  arrange(desc(lead_time))

# Pipes

---

## What is a pipe?

In programming, a pipe is a technique for passing information from one process to another.

--

.pull-left[
- Start with the data frame `hotels`, and pass it to the `select()` function,
]
.pull-right[
.small[
```{r}
hotels %>% #<<
  select(hotel, lead_time) %>%
  arrange(desc(lead_time))
```
]
]

]
.pull-right[

```
]

## Aside

The pipe operator is implemented in the package **magrittr**, though we don't need to load this package explicitly since **tidyverse** does this for us.

--

.question[
Any guesses as to why the package is called magrittr?
]

--

.pull-left[
```{r magritte, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", caption = "Magritte's pipe"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/magritte.jpg")
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r magrittr, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", caption = "magrittr's pipe"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/magrittr.jpg")
```
]

## How does a pipe work?

- You can think about the following sequence of actions - find keys, 
unlock car, start car, drive to work, park.

--
- Expressed as a set of nested functions in R pseudocode this would look like:
```{r eval=FALSE}
park(drive(start_car(find("keys")), to = "work"))
```

--
- Writing it out using pipes give it a more natural (and easier to read) 
structure:
```{r eval=FALSE}
find("keys") %>%
  start_car() %>%
  drive(to = "work") %>%
  park()
```

---

## A note on piping and layering

- `%>%` used mainly in **dplyr** pipelines, *we pipe the output of the previous line of code as the first input of the next line of code*

--
- `+` used in **ggplot2** plots is used for "layering", *we create the plot in layers, separated by `+`*

---

## dplyr

.midi[
`r emo::ji("x")`

```{r error=TRUE}
hotels +
  select(hotel, lead_time)
```

`r emo::ji("white_check_mark")`

```{r eval=FALSE}
hotels %>%
  select(hotel, lead_time)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, output.lines=6}
hotels %>%
  select(hotel, lead_time)
```
]

---

## ggplot2

.midi[
`r emo::ji("x")`

```{r error=TRUE}
ggplot(hotels, aes(x = hotel, fill = deposit_type)) %>%
  geom_bar()
```

`r emo::ji("white_check_mark")`

```{r out.width="25%"}
ggplot(hotels, aes(x = hotel, fill = deposit_type)) +
  geom_bar()
```
]

---

## Code styling

Many of the styling principles are consistent across `%>%` and `+`:

- always a space before
- always a line break after (for pipelines with more than 2 lines)

`r emo::ji("x")`

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(hotels,aes(x=hotel,y=deposit_type))+geom_bar()
```

`r emo::ji("white_check_mark")`

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(hotels, aes(x = hotel, y = deposit_type)) + 
  geom_bar()
```

# `select`, `arrange`, and `slice`

---

## `select` to keep variables

```{r}
hotels %>%
  select(hotel, lead_time) #<<
```

---

## `select` to exclude variables

.small[
```{r output.lines=18}
hotels %>%
  select(-agent) #<<
```
]

---

## `select` a range of variables

```{r}
hotels %>%
  select(hotel:arrival_date_month) #<<
```

---

## `select` variables with certain characteristics

```{r}
hotels %>%
  select(starts_with("arrival")) #<<
```

---

## `select` variables with certain characteristics

```{r}
hotels %>%
  select(ends_with("type")) #<<
```

---

## Select helpers

- `starts_with()`: Starts with a prefix
- `ends_with()`: Ends with a suffix
- `contains()`: Contains a literal string
- `num_range()`: Matches a numerical range like x01, x02, x03
- `one_of()`: Matches variable names in a character vector
- `everything()`: Matches all variables
- `last_col()`: Select last variable, possibly with an offset
- `matches()`: Matches a regular expression (a sequence of symbols/characters expressing a string/pattern to be searched for within text)

.footnote[
See help for any of these functions for more info, e.g. `?everything`.
]

---

## `arrange` in ascending / descending order

.pull-left[
```{r}
hotels %>%
  select(adults, children, babies) %>%
  arrange(babies) #<<
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
hotels %>%
  select(adults, children, babies) %>%
  arrange(desc(babies)) #<<
```
]

---

## `slice` for certain row numbers

.midi[
```{r output.lines=17}
# first five
hotels %>%
  slice(1:5) #<<
```
]

---

.tip[
In R, you can use the `#` for adding comments to your code. 
Any text following `#` will be printed as is, and won't be run as R code.
This is useful for leaving comments in your code and for temporarily disabling 
certain lines of code while debugging.
]

.small[
```{r output.lines=10}
hotels %>%
  # slice the first five rows  # this line is a comment
  #select(hotel) %>%           # this one doesn't run
  slice(1:5)                   # this line runs
```
]

---

class: middle

# `filter`

---

## `filter` to select a subset of rows

.midi[
```{r output.lines=17}
# bookings in City Hotels
hotels %>%
  filter(hotel == "City Hotel") #<<
````
]

---

## `filter` for many conditions at once

```{r}
hotels %>%
  filter( 
    adults == 0,     #<<
    children >= 1    #<<
    ) %>% 
  select(adults, babies, children)
```

---

## `filter` for more complex conditions

```{r}
# bookings with no adults and some children or babies in the room
hotels %>%
  filter( 
    adults == 0,     
    children >= 1 | babies >= 1     # | means or  #<<
    ) %>%
  select(adults, babies, children)
```

`summarize()` changes the data frame entirely, it collapses rows down to a single 
summary statistic, and removes all columns that are irrelevant to the calculation.

`summarize()` also lets you get away with being sloppy and not naming your new

## `group_by` for grouped operations

```{r}
# mean average daily rate for all booking at city and resort hotels
hotels %>%
  group_by(hotel) %>% #<<
  summarize(mean_adr = mean(adr))
```

---

## Calculating frequencies

The following two give the same result, so `count` is simply short for `group_by` then determine frequencies 

.pull-left[
```{r}
hotels %>%
  group_by(hotel) %>%
  summarize(n = n())
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
hotels %>%
  count(hotel)
```

---

## Multiple summary statistics

`summarize` can be used for multiple summary statistics as well

```{r}
hotels %>%
  summarize(
    min_adr = min(adr),
    mean_adr = mean(adr),
    median_adr = median(adr),
    max_adr = max(adr)
    )
