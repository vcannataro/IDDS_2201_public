# The R environment and R objects 

When you `assign` an object to a data structure in R, you store the object in the R environment.

```{r}
my_object <- 3
```

--

We can check what the object looks like by typing it into the console and pressing enter...

```{r}
my_object
```

--

... or by inspecting the object in the environment tab in RStudio

```{r, echo=F,out.width="40%"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "img/RStudio_env.png")
```

---


We can manipulate objects and use them in computation, but those analyses are 
stored for subsequent use **only if** they are assigned to an object themselves. More info [here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-basics.html).

--

```{r}
my_object * 2
```

```{r}
my_object
```

--

```{r}
my_new_object <- my_object * 2 
```

```{r}
my_object
my_new_object
```

.question[Why does this code **not** do what we intend?]

```{r, error=T}
starwars %>%
  mutate(BMI = mass/height) %>%
  select(name, height, mass, BMI)

ggplot(data = starwars, aes(y=BMI, x = height)) + 
  geom_point()
```

---
**We never stored the work in our environment.**

Two possible solutions: 

.pull-left[
A direct pipe
```{r, warning=F}
starwars %>%
  mutate(BMI = mass/height) %>%
  select(name, height, mass, BMI) %>% #<<
  ggplot(aes(y = BMI, x = height)) + 
  geom_point()
```
]


.pull-right[
Saving a new object and plotting that
```{r, warning=F}
starwars_bmi <- starwars %>% #<<
  mutate(BMI = mass/height) %>%
  select(name, height, mass, BMI)
ggplot(data = starwars_bmi, aes(y = BMI, x = height)) + #<<
  geom_point()
```

]

# Dimensions of objects

## One value

```{r}
my_object
```

--

## Multiple values in a vector
```{r}
my_vector <- c("One","Two","Pineapple","Squirrel")
my_vector
```

---

# Dimensions of objects

## Multiple variables in a data frame

.pull-left[
```{r, warning=F,message=F}
my_data_frame <- 
  data.frame(var1 = my_vector, 
             var2 = c(1,2,8,17))
my_data_frame
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, warning=F,message=F}
library(tidyverse)
my_data_frame <- 
  tibble(var1 = my_vector, 
         var2 = c(1,2,8,17))
my_data_frame
```

# Pulling data out of objects

There are many ways to extract data from an R object.

## Using `[ , ]` on an object with one value

```{r}
my_object[1] # pull out the first value in this object
```

```{r}
my_object[2] # pull out the second value in this object
```

# Pulling data out of objects

## Using `[ , ]` on an object with many values

```{r}
my_vector[1] # pull out the first value in this object
```

```{r}
my_vector[3] # pull out the third value in this object
```

```{r}
my_vector[10] # pull out the tenth value in this object
```

# Pulling data out of objects

There are many ways to extract data from an R object.

## Using `[ , ]` on a dataframe

For 2-dimensional objects, `[,]` operates as `[row,column]`

```{r}
my_data_frame[4,1] 
```

.question[Subsetting tibbles returns tibbles. What if we wanted to grab that single value 
as a single character object, not a tibble object?]

## Using `$` on a `named` object. 

`$` pulls out the named variable.
