# Terminology

---

## Number of variables involved

- Univariate data analysis - distribution of single variable
- Bivariate data analysis - relationship between two variables
- Multivariate data analysis - relationship between many variables at once, usually focusing on the relationship between two while conditioning for others

---

## Types of variables

- **Numerical variables** can be classified as **continuous** or **discrete** based on whether or not the variable can take on an infinite number of values or only non-negative whole numbers, respectively.
- If the variable is **categorical**, we can determine if it is **ordinal** based on whether or not the levels have a natural ordering.

# Data

## Data: Lending Club

.pull-left-wide[

- Thousands of loans made through the Lending Club, which is a platform that allows individuals to lend to other individuals

- Not all loans are created equal -- ease of getting a loan depends on (apparent) ability to pay back the loan

- Data includes loans *made*, these are not loan applications
]
.pull-right-narrow[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/lending-club.png")
```

## Take a peek at data

```{r output.lines=18}
library(openintro)
glimpse(loans_full_schema)
```

---

## Selected variables

```{r}
loans <- loans_full_schema %>%
  select(loan_amount, interest_rate, term, grade, 
         state, annual_income, homeownership, debt_to_income)
glimpse(loans)
```

## Selected variables

<br>

.midi[
variable        | description
----------------|-------------
`loan_amount`   |	Amount of the loan received, in US dollars
`interest_rate` |	Interest rate on the loan, in an annual percentage
`term`	        | The length of the loan, which is always set as a whole number of months
`grade`	        | Loan grade, which takes a values A through G and represents the quality of the loan and its likelihood of being repaid
`state`         |	US state where the borrower resides
`annual_income` |	Borrowerâ€™s annual income, including any second income, in US dollars
`homeownership`	| Indicates whether the person owns, owns but has a mortgage, or rents

## Describing shapes of numerical distributions

- shape:
    - skewness: right-skewed, left-skewed, symmetric (skew is to the side of the longer tail)
    - modality: unimodal, bimodal, multimodal, uniform
- center: mean (`mean`), median (`median`), mode (not always useful)
- spread: range (`range`), standard deviation (`sd`), inter-quartile range (`IQR`)
- unusual observations

# Relationships between numerical and categorical variables

## Already talked about...

- Coloring and faceting histograms and density plots
- Side-by-side box plots

## Violin plots

```{r warning = FALSE}
ggplot(loans, aes(x = homeownership, y = loan_amount)) +
  geom_violin()
```

---

## Violin plots... *with data*

```{r warning = FALSE}
ggplot(loans, aes(x = homeownership, y = loan_amount)) +
  geom_violin() + 
  geom_jitter(alpha=0.15,height = 0.2,width = 0.2) + #<<
  theme_bw() #<<

## Ridge plots

```{r warning = FALSE}

# Viewing, storing, and saving plots


---

## Viewing immediately

Printing my plot within the RMarkdown document or to the console:

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# call ggplot() without storing it into a data structure
ggplot(loans, aes(x = homeownership, y = loan_amount)) +
  geom_violin()
```

---

## Saving my plot to a data structure, then viewing

First we create the plot, but we store it without viewing
```{r}
# call ggplot() without storing it into a data structure
my_plot <- ggplot(loans, aes(x = homeownership, y = loan_amount)) +
  geom_violin()
```

--

Then we can view the plot
```{r, out.width="40%"}
my_plot
```


---

Or even add more to the plot

```{r}
my_plot + 
  labs(y= "Loan amount" ) + 
  theme_classic()
```

---

## Saving a plot

Once a plot is stored in memory (in a data structure), we can save it!

```{r, message=T}
ggsave(filename = "figures/my_plot.png",plot = my_plot, height = 5,width = 5)
```
