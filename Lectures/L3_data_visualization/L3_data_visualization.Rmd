# What is in a dataset?

---

## Dataset terminology

- Each row is an **observation**
- Each column is a **variable**

.small[

```{r message=FALSE}
starwars
```

]

---

## Luke Skywalker

![luke-skywalker](img/luke-skywalker.png)

---

## What's in the Star Wars data?

Take a `glimpse` at the data:

```{r}
glimpse(starwars)
```

---

.question[
How many rows and columns does this dataset have?
What does each row represent?
What does each column represent?
]

```{r eval = FALSE}
?starwars
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/starwars-help.png")
```

---

.question[
How many rows and columns does this dataset have?
]

.pull-left[
```{r}
nrow(starwars) # number of rows
ncol(starwars) # number of columns
dim(starwars)  # dimensions (row column)

# Exploratory data analysis

---

## What is EDA?

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analysing data sets to summarize its main characteristics
- Often, this is visual -- this is what we'll focus on first
- But we might also calculate summary statistics and perform data wrangling/manipulation/transformation at (or before) this stage of the analysis -- this is what we'll focus on next

---

## Mass vs. height

.question[ 
How would you describe the relationship between mass and height of Starwars characters?
What other variables would help us understand data points that don't follow the overall trend?
Who is the not so tall but really heavy character?
]

```{r fig.width = 8, warning = FALSE, echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Mass vs. height of Starwars characters",
       x = "Height (cm)", y = "Weight (kg)") +
  geom_point(data = starwars %>% filter(name == "Jabba Desilijic Tiure"), size = 5, pch = 1, color = "pink", stroke = 3)
```

---

## Jabba!

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, cache = TRUE, out.width = "80%"}
jabba <- image_read("img/jabba.png")

fig <- image_graph(width = 1600, height = 900, res = 200)

# Data visualization

## Data visualization

> *"The simple graph has brought more information to the data analyst's mind than any other device." --- John Tukey*

- Data visualization is the creation and study of the visual representation of data
- Many tools for visualizing data -- R is one of them
- Many approaches/systems within R for making data visualizations -- **ggplot2** is one of them, and that's what we're going to use

## Hello ggplot2!

.pull-left-wide[
- `ggplot()` is the main function in ggplot2
- Plots are constructed in layers
- Structure of the code for plots can be summarized as

```{r eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = [dataset], 
       mapping = aes(x = [x-variable], y = [y-variable])) +
  geom_xxx() +
  other options
```

- The ggplot2 package comes with the tidyverse

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

## Mapping vs. setting

- **Mapping:** Determine the size, alpha, etc. of points based on the values of a variable in the data
  - goes into `aes()`

- **Setting:** Determine the size, alpha, etc. of points **not** based on the values of a variable in the data
  - goes into `geom_*()` (this was `geom_point()` in the previous example, but we'll learn about other geoms soon!)

# Faceting

---

## Faceting

- Smaller plots that display different subsets of the data
- Useful for exploring conditional relationships and large data

---

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Plot]
```{r ref.label = "facet", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, out.width = "70%"}
```
]
.panel[.panel-name[Code]

```{r facet, fig.show = "hide"}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(species ~ island) #<<
```
]
]

## Various ways to facet

.question[
In the next few slides describe what each plot displays. Think about how the code relates to the output.

**Note:** The plots in the next few slides do not have proper titles, axis labels, etc. because we want you to figure out what's happening in the plots.
But you should always label your plots!

```{r warning = FALSE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(species ~ sex) #<<
```

---

```{r warning = FALSE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(sex ~ species) #<<
```

---

```{r warning = FALSE, fig.asp = 0.5}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ species) #<<
```

---

```{r warning = FALSE, fig.asp = 0.5}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(. ~ species) #<<
```

---

```{r warning = FALSE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ species, ncol = 2) #<<
```

## Faceting summary

- `facet_grid()`:
    - 2d grid
    - `rows ~ cols`
    - use `.` for no split
- `facet_wrap()`: 1d ribbon wrapped according to number of rows and columns specified or available plotting area

## Facet and color

.pull-left-narrow[
```{r facet-color-legend, fig.show = "hide", warning = FALSE}
ggplot(
  penguins, 
  aes(x = bill_depth_mm, 
      y = bill_length_mm, 
      color = species)) + #<<
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(species ~ sex) +
  scale_color_viridis_d() #<<
```
]
.pull-right-wide[
```{r ref.label = "facet-color-legend", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
```
]

---

## Face and color, no legend

.pull-left-narrow[
```{r facet-color-no-legend, fig.show = "hide", warning = FALSE}
ggplot(
  penguins, 
  aes(x = bill_depth_mm, 
      y = bill_length_mm, 
      color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(species ~ sex) +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  guides(color = FALSE) #<<
```
]
.pull-right-wide[
```{r ref.label = "facet-color-no-legend", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
```
]
